> “The future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said.” — Geoffrey Hinton

> “Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence — in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement — wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.” — Eliezer Yudkowsky

Learner in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the Machine Learning (ML) field. Trying to share some projects that have been previously developed through main and side projects. I enjoy learning new things such as mathematical concepts in ML and technologies that involve AI. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ML projects 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mathematical concepts in ML 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Just AI and Mathematics
